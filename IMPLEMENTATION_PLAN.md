# Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for building a production-ready, type-safe FastAPI backend for saving recipes, following the requirements in cursorrules.md and the structure in PLANNED_STRUCTURE.md.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization
1. Initialize a git repository.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Create the project folder structure as per PLANNED_STRUCTURE.md.
4. Add .env, .gitignore, and initial README.md.

## Phase 2: Tooling & Configuration
5. Create requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt with all dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, pytest, httpx, mypy, black, isort, flake8, pre-commit, python-dotenv, fastapi-users, passlib, python-jose, etc.).
6. Set up black, isort, flake8, mypy, and pre-commit configuration files.
7. Add pyproject.toml for unified tool configuration.
8. Set up Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local development and deployment.

## Phase 3: Core Application Setup
9. Scaffold FastAPI app in app/main.py.
10. Set up app/core/config.py for environment/config management using python-dotenv.
11. Set up app/core/logging.py for logging configuration.
12. Set up app/db/session.py and app/db/base.py for SQLAlchemy session and base model.

## Phase 4: Authentication & User Management
13. Integrate fastapi-users for user registration, login, and JWT authentication.
14. Set up app/models/user.py and app/schemas/user.py for user models and schemas.
15. Configure app/core/security.py for JWT and password hashing.
16. Set up app/dependencies/auth.py for authentication dependencies.

## Phase 5: Recipe Feature
17. Create app/models/recipe.py and app/schemas/recipe.py for recipe data.
18. Implement app/services/recipe_service.py for recipe business logic.
19. Add app/api/v1/recipes.py for recipe endpoints.

## Phase 6: Database & Migrations
20. Set up Alembic for migrations.
21. Create initial migration for user and recipe tables.

## Phase 7: Testing
22. Set up tests/ directory with conftest.py, test_users.py, and test_recipes.py.
23. Write tests for user registration, login, and recipe CRUD.

## Phase 8: Quality & CI
24. Set up pre-commit hooks for formatting, linting, and type checks.
25. Add CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions) for tests, linting, and type checks.

## Phase 9: Documentation & Finalization
26. Update README.md with setup, usage, and contribution instructions.
27. Review and finalize all configs and code for production readiness.
